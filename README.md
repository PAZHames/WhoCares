## Introduction

I (Phoebe) have been a carer for my Grandma for the last two and a half years. She raised me, so it's almost a direct transaction 😅. It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, but it is also very, very hard. Caring can be a very isolating experience, especially as a younger carer, and it can often leave you wanting for a sense of community and understanding. 

This is why we (Rebecca ✨, Jess 💫, Priscilla 🌟 and Phoebe 🙋‍♀️) are building WhoCares: a platform for carers of all types to access and build communities to support and care for those who spend their time caring for others. 

Users can connect with other carers, join groups and attend meetups. Caring can be a full-time job and travelling long distances can make attending events impossible. We are therefore building in a strong focus on geographic location, with the platform suggesting groups and events in your area. Boroughs and local councils can also build their own pages, adding information about available help and resources and making people aware of local meetups.
